    - Backend.pm: Be backwards-compatible by not doing "keys $hashref"

1.48  Sun May 22 17:12:03 GMT 2011
    - Don't enable debug output if a plugin enables raw events
    - Backend.pm: Fix issues with listening on the same port on multiple

      add a listener.
    - croak() instead of warn() when add_peer() is called wrong
    - Document peer name argument to ircd_connected

    - IRC.pm: Emit ircd_daemon_error on failed peer registration
    - Depend on PoCo-Client-DNS and PoCo-Client-Ident again, since most
      people will want them, and authentication is enabled by default.

    - Only load POE::Filter::Zlib::Stream when using ziplinks

1.46  Fri May 20 12:12:08 GMT 2011
    - Backend.pm: Document the 'idle', 'antiflood', and 'usessl' parameters
      to add_listener()

      installs and warn of API changes.

      results.
